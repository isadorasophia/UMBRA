Faceless Infant
It starts screaming - not like every scream, but a LOUD and UNBEARABLE scream. You start considering killing yourself of agony, when it suddenly stops. The creature is gone, swallowed by its own misery.
It starts screaming - you want to run away, you want to get out of there. But it is useless. The creature opens up its face and the hole becomes even darker as if... it was ready to eat your soul. Your last memory was the figure approaching you until there was only darkness.
A creature approaches you. For an instant, you seem to be alone in the darkness - but some strange noises begin to torment you. These noises become louder and louder. It doesn't seem right - these noises assembles to some unbearable weeping along with a sadistic laugh.
Finally, you see a figure. It is wearing a lovely dress, full of hearts... living hearts and entrails, rotting every step. And its face... although it had a beautiful long dark hair, there wasn't a nose, or an eye, or a mouth, only a deep and hollow hole, eerie as if it could swallow your entire soul: with only one laugh.
