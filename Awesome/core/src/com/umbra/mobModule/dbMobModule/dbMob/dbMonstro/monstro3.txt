Melancholic Mistress
The creature faces you and stares at you, deeply into your soul. You feel naked, exposed, a miserable and pitiful cockroach. You feel yourself dying in the inside, and the figure comes faster and faster into your direction and... vanishes. You find yourself alone, again, in the darkness.
The creature faces you and starts mumbling some random words in a dreadful voice. You are sure that these are some bad words, as if \"she\" was weeping... and then laughing again. And approaches you. You are scared and want to run away, but you can't move a thing. She gets closer and closer and... open her mounth as if she was about to kiss you - but, instead, a black goo comes out her mouth and cover your face and you feel your skin melting, slowly... until there was only darkness.
A creature approaches you. It seems to be a beautiful lady. She was completely naked, exposing her ribs along with an apparently fragile body and small feet. Her hands... weren't quite hands. They seem to be fading into the darkness. And her face, such a marvelous face, as if it were asking for help along with a melancholic look covering her sad eyes. \"She\" appeared to be looking into the void... and forward to you. 
Her sad look suddenly becomes three figures that seems to be crying in agony, with an unfocused aspect trembling: one smiling hysterically, one screaming with despair and the original melancholic look of the mysterious mistress. Terrified by her appearance, you forget that it is approaching you.
