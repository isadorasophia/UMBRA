Four giant eyes monitor their surroundings from their eerie sockets. A big nose rests below, but it's the small mouth below that takes all the attention. A gentle smile reveals several large broken teeth and a flat tongue.
Large warped ears sit on each side of its tiny, wrinkled head, which itself is covered in small tentacles and has two huge horns protruding from the sides.

Its tall skinny body is hunched over. Two broad stone-like arms rest at its sides and end in large hands with bent fingers, of which it has 8 in total.
Its legs are long and are bent, each ending in short paws.

Its body is covered in large feathers and its shoulders are narrower than its pelvis, from which a narrow tail sways back and forth.
