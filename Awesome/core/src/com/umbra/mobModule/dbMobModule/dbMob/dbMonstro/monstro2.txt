Rotting Worm
The creature starts screaming in agony, and thousands of moths seems to fly away its mouth, covering your entire vision. You are, for a second, blind: and then, there was nothing. You seemed to be left alone again.
The creature starts to shake immensely, and you do not know what will it do. And you nether want to know. Claustrophobic feelings starts to take control of your mind: let me out of here, let me out of here, let me out of here. Worms begin to take control of your vision, and you feel the agony of the cockroaches climbing into your body and the your flesh being eaten slowly. You cry for death, and its merciful kiss comes as a bless.
A creature approaches you. Disgust fills your spine as a helpless grub around a chaos: its face is full of worms, disgusting worms. You are terrified when you sense the feel of the maggots running all over your body, dying to eat all your flesh. The figure is likely the personification of that feeling with all the worms eating its skin and its entrails - its eyes were only deep and black hollows, looking for a hope, or... looking for a new flesh.
