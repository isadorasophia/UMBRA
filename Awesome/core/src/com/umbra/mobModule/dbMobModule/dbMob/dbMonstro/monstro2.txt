Hegug

Two hooded eyes observe their surroundings from their slimy sockets. A broad nose rests below, but it's the shallow mouth below that takes all the attention. A sardonic smile reveals two small canines and a forked tongue.
Large bony ears sit on each side of its large, angular head, which itself is covered in soft hair and has two curved horns protruding from the sides.

Its low thin body stands straight. Two long stone-like arms hang at its sides and end in bony hands with thin fingers, of which it has 8 in total.
Its legs are tall and are slightly bent, each ending in short hooves.

Its body is covered in armor-like scales and its shoulders are about the same width as its pelvis, from which a long tail sways back and forth.
