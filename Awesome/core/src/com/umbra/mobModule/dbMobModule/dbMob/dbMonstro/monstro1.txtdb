Yonkathu

Two close-set eyes observe their surroundings from their scaly sockets. A sharp nose rests below, but it's the small mouth below that takes all the attention. A gummy smile reveals rows of huge teeth and a wide tongue.
Enormous flappy ears sit on each side of its average, wrinkled head, which itself is covered in coarse hairs and has two huge horns protruding from the top.

Its small lean body stands straight. Two average fleshy arms rest at its sides and end in stone-like hands with bent fingers, of which it has 6 in total.
Its legs are tall and stand straight, each ending in small feet.

Its body is covered in large feathers and its shoulders are narrower than its pelvis, from which a thin tail sways back and forth.
