monstro1;Faceless Infant;It starts screaming - not like every scream, but a LOUD and UNBEARABLE scream. You start considering killing yourself of agony, when it suddenly stops. The creature is gone, swallowed by its own misery.;It starts screaming - you want to run away, you want to get out of there. But it is useless. The creature opens up its face and the hole becomes even darker as if... it was ready to eat your soul. Your last memory was the figure approaching you until there was only darkness.;A creature approaches you. For an instant, you seem to be alone in the darkness - but some strange noises begin to torment you. These noises become louder and louder. It doesn't seem right - these noises assembles to some unbearable weeping along with a sadistic laugh.;Finally, you see a figure. It is wearing a lovely dress, full of hearts... living hearts and entrails, rotting every step. And its face... although it had a beautiful long dark hair, there wasn't a nose, or an eye, or a mouth, only a deep and hollow hole, eerie as if it could swallow your entire soul: with only one laugh.
monstro2;Rotting Worm;The creature starts screaming in agony, and thousands of moths seems to fly away its mouth, covering your entire vision. You are, for a second, blind: and then, there was nothing. You seemed to be left alone again.;The creature starts to shake immensely, and you do not know what will it do. And you nether want to know. Claustrophobic feelings begin to take control of your mind: let me out of here, let me out of here, let me out of here. Worms begin to occupy your vision, and you feel the agony of cockroaches climbing into your body and your flesh being eaten slowly. You cry for death, and its merciful kiss comes as a bless.;A creature approaches you. Disgust fills your spine as a helpless grub around a chaos: its face is full of worms, disgusting worms. You are terrified when you sense the feel of the maggots running all over your body, dying to eat your flesh. The figure is likely the personification of that feeling... all the worms were eating its skin and its entrails - its eyes were left with deep and black hollows, looking for a hope, or... looking for a new flesh.
monstro3;Melancholic Mistress;The creature faces you and stares at you, deeply into your soul. You feel naked, exposed, a miserable and pitiful cockroach. You feel yourself dying on the inside, and the figure comes faster and faster in your direction and... vanishes. You find yourself alone, again, in the darkness.;The creature faces you and starts mumbling some words in a dreadful voice. You are sure that these are some bad words, as if "she" was weeping... and then laughing again. And approaches you. You are scared and want to run away, but you can't move a thing. She gets closer and closer and... open her mounth as if she was about to kiss you - but, instead, a black goo comes out her mouth and cover your face. You feel your skin melting, slowly... until there was only darkness.;A creature approaches you. It seems to be a beautiful lady. She was completely naked, exposing her ribs along with an apparently fragile body and small feet.;Her hands... weren't quite hands. They seem to be fading into the darkness. Her face, such a marvelous face!, as if it were asking for help along with a melancholic look covering her sad eyes. "She" appeared to be looking into the void... and forward to you. ;Her sad look suddenly becomes three figures that seems to be crying in agony, with an unfocused aspect trembling: one smiling hysterically, one screaming with despair and the original melancholic look of the mysterious mistress. Terrified by her appearance, you forget that it is approaching you.
